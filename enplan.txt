Code and problem issues:
  Legendre
U RBF NN
  X > get it to stop defaulting to 0 so much.
  > Bias term.
  Fourier -- get it better conditioned with more elements
  > see paper on nonuniform 2d (should be in Mendeley)
I General Polynomial with bias term
I Cheybychev polynomial
RB with entire dataset?

Plots:
U Tradeoff plots for RBFNN and Legendre
  > Need to fix derivative of Legendre
  > currently have run issues
  Compare Plots
  > Response at level plot
  > multiple reconstructions -- adjust coloring
  Debugging
  > Why are Legendre and RBF so ill-conditioned?
U Comparison Plots for synthetic problems
T Plotting Variations for RBFN when doing 2d
U Fix all the label problems with the plots in general
  >frequency instead of order
  >not displaying center locations
T Comparison Plot with holdout data

Others:
I Artificial Datasets

Report:
U Add some stuff on machine learning.
Alternate paper idea: Legendre only, simplified mean plane only. Go through a problem and estimate convex regions for interest

Refactor for simplicity before proceeding

Dreams:
  More sophisticated NN
  heirarchical modelling from steps with explanation module
  Constrained Mean Plane

X New Mean Plane Methods
  >Turns out idea was already implemented
  >Maybe something more sophisticated is necessary
  Get the optimized mean plane method running anyway
U verify that current mean plane isn't degenerate by just checking normal vectors

X Synthetic Runs with non-FFT

T FFT with truncated Vandermonde

Redo plots to better take advantage of particularities of RBF and Legendre.

Legend:
U urgent
T todo
I ignore
X done
